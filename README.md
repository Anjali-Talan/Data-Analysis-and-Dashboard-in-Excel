The FURM store aims to develop an annual sales report for 2022 to provide the CEO with insights into customer behavior and identify opportunities to boost sales in 2023.

Insights :-

The data shows that women are more likely to purchase than men, making up about 65% of the sales. Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh are the top-performing states, contributing around 35% of the total sales. Customers in the adult age group (30-49 years) are the largest contributors, accounting for 50% of sales. Additionally, most purchases come through Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra, which together contribute approximately 80%. To boost sales, FURM Store should focus on targeting women aged 30-49 in these top states by promoting ads, offers, and coupons on these popular platforms.
